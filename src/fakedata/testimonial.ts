      "Great Uk based hosting for a good price. Very easy to use also they have a one click installer system so it’s easy to get Wordpress installed. Also I have my domain registered previously with a different company but they make it easy to link your hosting with domains registered elsewhere. Haven’t needed to use their customer service yet so can’t review that aspect. But 10/10 from me so far.",
